<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

As I have build, rebuilt, and expanded my homelab, I always wanted a better way to monitor SSH traffic and restrict it. So I built these bastion host SSH script. You have 3 different scripts, the first will create a new user of your choice on your bastion host, install Google PAM for MFA, and then lockdown SSH to that user. The second script is the SSH lockdown for the remote host. The last one will be added to the ~/.bashrc at the end to restrict the terminal access
